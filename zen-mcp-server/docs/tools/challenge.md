# challenge - Challenge an approach or validate ideas with confidence

The `challenge` tool encourages thoughtful critical thinking instead of automatic agreement with the dreaded **You're absolutely right!** responses - especially 
when you're not. This tool wraps your comment with instructions that prompt critical thinking and honest analysis instead of blind agreement.

## Quick Example

```
challenge but do we even need all this extra caching because it'll just slow the app down?
```

```
challenge I don't think this approach solves my original complaint
```

Normally, your favorite coding agent will enthusiastically reply with **“You’re absolutely right!”**—then proceed to 
reverse the _correct_ strategy entirely, without stopping to consider that you might actually be wrong, missing the 
bigger picture or ignoring architectural constraints.

`challenge` fixes this. Claude can even _detect_ when you're challenging something and automatically invokes this tool
to ensure thoughtful analysis instead of reflexive agreement.
