"""
Test to reproduce and fix the OpenRouter model name resolution bug.

This test specifically targets the bug where:
1. User specifies "gemini" in consensus tool
2. System incorrectly resolves to "gemini-2.5-pro" instead of "google/gemini-2.5-pro"
3. OpenRouter API returns "gemini-2.5-pro is not a valid model ID"
